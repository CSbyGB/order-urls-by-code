# Order url by code

This script has been made to get all 400 response code from a list of url.  
I am planning on upgrading it so that it can sort url by response code.

## TODO

- [x] Make it sort url by code an outputing a different file for each family of code (file for all 400, file for all 500, etc)
- [x] Handle errors
- [ ] Set a decent timeout
- [ ] Make a fancy menu with options and all
